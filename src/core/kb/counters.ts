/**
 * What the other team's agents make you play around, and what answers it: the advice a coach gives
 * once the other team's comp is known. Each threat is one strength of theirs (kb/roles.ts), the
 * side you're on when it matters, and the strengths of yours that answer it, written like map needs
 * (`smoke +.6; flash +.45`, see maps.ts) and about as big: knowing their comp counts about as much as
 * the map does. The engine adds those needs as far as the threat goes (see threatsOf
 * in engine/model.ts), so comps that answer it rank higher, and a comp's pros and cons say so.
 *
 * How far a threat goes: each of their agents adds what their kit brings to the strength (on this
 * map and side) above `from`, and `full` of that is the whole threat. For some threats (`second`) only the agents after their strongest count, since
 * every team has one: one controller is normal, two controllers smoking a site is the threat.
 *
 * The words: `threat` starts with their agents (`{who}` becomes "Their Chamber" or "Their Chamber
 * and Jett") and then the verb in braces, written as for one agent (`{holds}` becomes "hold" for
 * two). `advice` is how to play around the threat without the utility that answers it, since it's
 * for a comp that has little of that utility: it must not lean on the strengths in `answer`.
 * Sources: the game's ability text (content.gen.ts) and how pro teams prepare for a known comp.
