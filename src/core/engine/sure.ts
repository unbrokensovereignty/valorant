/**
 * How sure a fit is. Most of a fit rests on things with a lot of play behind them, but three parts
 * can rest on very little, and each could be off by about as much as it could count:
 *
 * - `early`: the ranked win rate of an agent in their first days (earlyStats in kb/agents.ts), which
 *   could turn out anywhere within WIN_CAP once players have learned the agent;
 * - `pro`: what pro teams would pick, for an agent who came out after the year's top events
 *   (proKnown in kb/pro.ts), whose pull could be anywhere within SURE.pro of none;
 * - `kit`: the kit rules (kb/kitfit.ts) of an agent with early numbers, which no play has checked
 *   yet; each could be off by SURE.kit of what it adds.
 *
 * They're taken as independent, so they add up as the root of the sum of their squares, and are
 * measured in points of the agent's fit, against the same reference the fit was read from. A fit
 * is less sure when that comes to SURE.less points or more: about a tier's worth.
